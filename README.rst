Welcome to lucene++ version **3.0.2**.

Lucene++ is an up to date C++ port of the popular Lucene, a high-performance, full-featured text search engine library.


Components
----------------

- liblucene++ library
- liblucene_contrib library
- lucene_tester
- deletefiles
- indexfiles
- searchfiles


Useful Resources
----------------

Official `Java Lucene <http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html>`_ - useful links and documentation relevant to Lucene and lucene++.
`Lucene in Action <http://www.amazon.com/Lucene-Action-Otis-Gospodnetic/dp/1932394281/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1261343174&sr=8-1>`_ by Otis Gospodnetic and Erik Hatcher.


Build Instructions using CMake
------------------------------
You'll need boost installed somewhere. On Debian systems, the following
packages are required:

libboost-date-time-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-regex-dev libboost-thread-dev libboost-iostreams-dev libboost-test-dev

Build Instructions for POSIX systems
------------------------------------

We use `Waf <http://code.google.com/p/waf/>`_ to drive the build. Waf requires that you have a recent version of `Python <http://python.org>`_ installed on your system.  

To build the library the following commands should be issued::

    $ ./waf configure
    $ ./waf build


Additionally static builds of the following libraries are required for a successful build:

- boost::system
- boost::thread
- boost::filesystem
- boost::regex
- boost::date_time
- boost::unit_test_framework

The libraries and headers should be made available at a standard prefix (/usr/local for example).


Build Instructions for Windows systems
--------------------------------------

Open solution lucene++.sln located in the msvc folder into Visual Studio 2008 and build.
