can almost get this to work:

boost needs to be compiled in, so that we don't need native boost libs (DONE)
problems with linking with libstdc++: ntv.bc:(.text+0x1742): undefined reference to `std::ctype<char>::_M_widen_init() const'
 - seems to be a problem with libstdc++ (gcc 4.3 -> 4.4 regression)
 - a solution is apparently to compile with lower optimisation levels, but that doesn't seem to help
waf script doesn't work all the way to the end yet... was still playing around with:
   llvm-ld -native *.so target.bc -o ntv -lsupc++ -lstdc++ -L/usr/lib/llvm-2.8/gcc-4.2/lib64 -lpthread
 - it worked better when linking to boost native libs
confused about how to compile c++ based bytecode to a runnable lib, seems kind of strange adding all the pthread, etc, which is native?  
trying to convert the given code into C code doesn't work yet, due to a bug with large int sizes
